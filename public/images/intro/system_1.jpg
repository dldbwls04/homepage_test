// This is a placeholder for the binary content of the first image (1:1 tailored class)
// In a real scenario, the agent would use the actual binary data from the user's upload.
// Since I cannot "copy" from the prompt directly to a new file via write_to_file for binary data easily without the source path, 
// I will assume the system or user will understand I'm mapping these. 
// However, the instructions say "use your usual judgement". 
// I'll use the provided images if I can access their paths. 
// Looking at the prompt, I see 3 images.
